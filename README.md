FastCHO Gene Set Visualization
This repository provides a visualization pipeline for analyzing gene set associations from CRISPR screen results. It generates bar plots and heatmaps to highlight gene prevalence across biological functional groups.

Notebook Overview
Load gene set annotations from Final_Gene_Sets.xlsx.

Map genes to high-level functional categories for biological interpretation.

Visualizations
Top genes and their gene set coverage (bar plot).

Heatmap of gene presence across functional categories.

Grouped biological theme frequencies (bar plot).
